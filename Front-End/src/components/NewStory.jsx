// Hey @Ajay 
// your next task is to build the layout for a React form component where a user can create a new story.

// This is just UI only so no submission or functionality needed yet.

// The form should include labeled inputs for:

// Story ID (text input)

// User ID (text input)

// Story Title (text input)

// Genres (text input for now â€” comma separated)

// Description (textarea)

// Make it clean, readable, and easy to fill out. No validation or logic for now, just structure and styling.

// Also you should display the component successfully on the bottom of the LandingPage.jsx by importing your newly made component.

// Place the component in src/components/NewStory.jsx
// Ping me when it's ready or if you have questions.

// this should not be a hard task but you are meant to struggle a bit. this task is due by wednesday (enough time for you to tackle it)

// when youre done just dm me and ill review the code!
